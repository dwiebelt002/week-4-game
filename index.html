    <h2 class="media-heading">How To Play</h2>
    <p>The Seven Kingdoms are at war! The royal families of Westeros now battle each other for the Iron Throne and control over the realm. Start by pressing the Select Character button to choose whom you want to play as. Next, choose which character you want to fight by clicking on the enemy select button and choosing the character to combat. Then keep pressing the Attack button to deal damage to your opponent until that enemy is defeated or until you are slain in battle. The game ends in victory when all of your enemies are defeated and you are the last one standing and the sole claimer of the Iron Throne. Do you have what it takes? Just remember, Winter is Coming...</p>
